I am a computer engineer who started developing software. Although, I discovered that design reports, documents, and writing procedures were something I liked more.
During my work experience, I developed embedded computer vision algorithms, designed product settings web pages (with HTML and Javascript), documented API and products, and improved my skills as a project manager.
This site presents my portfolio with samples of documents I wrote.
